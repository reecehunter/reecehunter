# ðŸ‘‹ Hello There
I'm a full-stack developer mainly using React & Tailwind for frontend, NodeJS & Express backend, and (MySQL || MongoDB || DynamoDB) & Redis databases. I also have some experience with Java and Python. That is just what I often use. I learn whatever is needed for the task at hand.

# ðŸš€ Current Interests
I recently found out about [Nostr](https://nostr.com/) and started contributing to [contribution](https://github.com/verbiricha/habla.news) the day I learned about the protocol. I'm currently learning more about the protocol before I start my own project.

I've also started building some projects on AWS, practicing CI/CD and scalability, which has been fun.
