# ðŸ‘‹ Hello There
I'm a full-stack web developer mainly using React && Tailwind for frontend, NodeJS && Express backend, and (MySQL || MongoDB || DynamoDB) && Redis databases. I also have some experience with Java and Python. That's just what I often use. I learn whatever is needed for the task at hand.

# ðŸš€ Activity
- Learning about building scalable applications with AWS.
- Building [Signstr](https://github.com/reecehunter/signstr), an open-source chrome extension for Nostr built to contain everything you need when navigating Nostr clients with UX in mind.
- Contributing to other open-source projects.
