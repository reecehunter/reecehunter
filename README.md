# ðŸ‘‹ Hello There
I'm a full-stack web developer located in Utah. I love building web applications using React + Chakra UI and AWS backend. That's just what I often use. I learn whatever is needed.

- Building [Valet Flow](https://valetflow.com), management software for valet trash businesses.
- Building [Signstr](https://github.com/reecehunter/signstr), an open-source chrome extension for Nostr built to contain everything you need when navigating Nostr clients.
